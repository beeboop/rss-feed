                      <span>There are obvious upsides to pair programming. This post from Nat Bennett shares both the ups and the downs of pairing all day for years‚Ä¶
So I paired all day, most days, for about five years. This had a lot of upsides, far more than I can list here. There‚Äôs a standard list of benefits and drawbacks to pairing that you might be familiar with, but the impact of pairing, especially pairing that much, goes much deeper than its impact on the code, on the particular work the team delivers that week.

Widely-respected security expert Dan Kaminsky passed away on April 23 from diabetic ketoacidosis at the age of 42. His considerable legacy went beyond expertise with a rare and memorable kindness.
I met Dan very briefly at ShmooCon back in 2004. His kindness was memorable, for sure, but the thing I remember most was just how larger-than-life he was to me at the time. The guy contributed so much to the infosec community and yet remained humble and kind despite it all. It was s‚Ä¶</span>

During COVID-19, Zoom-enabled tech workers have discovered the benefits of remote work from cheaper, less congested communities elsewhere. Is this the end of Silicon Valley as we know it? Perhaps.

I felt it was time to do another blog post to directly address the issue of entitlement by some open source users which is hurting open source, both for themselves and for others. I want to get the point across that open source maintainers owe you quite literally nothing when it comes to their open source code, and treating them poorly is unethical. And to me, this is the underlying social contract of open source. (emphasis added)

                      <span>This is an excellent article about understanding technical debt:
It is a fact that, over time, all development teams get slowed down by the existing codebase. But why? Is it because maintenance is inevitable? Or because we could do something better in the first place? Or both?
Luca argues that technical debt is introduced as a by-product of disagreement, which itself is a by-product of two phenomena: wrong design, and rapid evolution. Thoughtful stuff. Well worth your time.

Storing timestamps instead of booleans, however, is one of those things I can go out on a limb and say it doesn‚Äôt really depend all that much. You might as well timestamp it. There are plenty of times in my career when I‚Äôve stored a boolean and later wished I‚Äôd had a timestamp. There are zero times when I‚Äôve stored a timestamp and regretted that decision.
