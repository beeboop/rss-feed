                <p>Any concept that we don't fully understand can be scary at first. Recursion is a topic that programming students don't learn right away. But that doesn't mean it needs to be scary or cause anxiety. In fact, recursion is a concept that we can define rather simply. According to Wikipedia:</p>

                <p>The benefits of such a setup are numerous, especially for small sites and side projects:
Hosting a static website is much easier than a “real” server - there’s many free and reliable options (like GitHub, GitLab Pages, Netlify, etc), and it scales to basically infinity without any effort.
The how is also super interesting:
So how do you use a database on a static file hoster? Firstly, SQLite (written in C) is compiled to WebAssembly. SQLite can be compiled with emscripten without any modifications, and the …</p>

Many great Phoenix LiveView examples exist. They often show the ease and power of LiveView but stop at multiple browsers talking to a single web server.

Most implausible-sounding ideas are in fact bad and could be safely dismissed. But not when they’re proposed by reasonable domain experts. If the person proposing the idea is reasonable, then they know how implausible it sounds. And yet they’re proposing it anyway. That suggests they know something you don’t. And if they have deep domain expertise, that’s probably the source of it.

So as a frontend developer, why not solve it the way that fits better with what I am good at?

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>David Cassel, on The New Stack:
Widely-respected security expert Dan Kaminsky passed away on April 23 from diabetic ketoacidosis at the age of 42. His considerable legacy went beyond expertise with a rare and memorable kindness.

                <p>The feed is hosted on GitHub Pages (which means it’s public to all) and is static until it gets rebuilt. Building is done periodically via a GitHub Action; configuration is via a YAML file (It’d be cooler if you could import an OPML instead). Even if it’s not something you’d use, I think this project is interesting for two reasons:
It’s part of a “GitHub as Stack” meta-trend
It promotes RSS, which is one of the web’s great treasures

                <p>High-profile entrepreneurs like Elon Musk, venture capitalists like Peter Thiel and Keith Rabois, and big companies like Oracle and HP Enterprise are all leaving California. During COVID-19, Zoom-enabled tech workers have discovered the benefits of remote work from cheaper, less congested communities elsewhere. Is this the end of Silicon Valley as we know it? Perhaps. But other challenges to Silicon Valley’s preeminence are more fundamental than the tech diaspora.

                <p>Brett Cannon, who is a Python core developer (and a tall, snarky Canadian):
I felt it was time to do another blog post to directly address the issue of entitlement by some open source users which is hurting open source, both for themselves and for others. I want to get the point across that open source maintainers owe you quite literally nothing when it comes to their open source code, and treating them poorly is unethical. And to me, this is the underlying social contract of open source. (emphasis added)

                <p>Mongita is a lightweight embedded document database that implements a commonly-used subset of the MongoDB/PyMongo interface.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>This is an excellent article about understanding technical debt:
It is a fact that, over time, all development teams get slowed down by the existing codebase. But why? Is it because maintenance is inevitable? Or because we could do something better in the first place? Or both?
Luca argues that technical debt is introduced as a by-product of disagreement, which itself is a by-product of two phenomena: wrong design, and rapid evolution. Thoughtful stuff. Well worth your time.

This is a curated list of my favourite music DSP and audio programming resources. It was originally meant to be an official “Awesome list”, but apparently you are not meant to write in the first person, so it is now a “more awesome” list.
I’m still giving this the awesome topic, despite his first person point of view. Oli is a long-time audio programmer, so he’s well positioned to curate a list like this one.

                <p>In my 15+ years of web development, there are very few things I can say are unequivocally a good idea. It almost always does depend.
Storing timestamps instead of booleans, however, is one of those things I can go out on a limb and say it doesn’t really depend all that much. You might as well timestamp it. There are plenty of times in my career when I’ve stored a boolean and later wished I’d had a timestamp. There are zero times when I’ve stored a timestamp and regretted that decision.

Even though most of our users deliver software to us as Docker containers, we don’t use Docker to run them.
